A project to study fire truck arrival times in Washington DC

Using established models from Rand Corporation studies, I am working to model fire engin arrival times in Washington DC and make determinations about engine comapy response times.  The data present in this project presens a current problem as the engine arrival times are entered after the incident occurs and have so many entries at the 30 minute mark plus a close read of the conclusions of the dissertation linked at https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/ws/send_file/send?accession=ucin1250045718&disposition=inline
sugest that NFIRS data hs such inherent reliability issues that is offers no practical value in this area.
